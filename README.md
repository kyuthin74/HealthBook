  ## About the app

  The Appointment Booking App is a Vite + React experience that streamlines scheduling for clinics and hospitals. Patients can browse providers, request time slots, and track confirmations, while staff members manage upcoming visits through dashboards, rosters, and detail views. The interface mirrors the linked Figma design and ships with mock data, Tailwind-based styling, and Supabase integration hooks so teams can quickly plug in real authentication, storage, and notifications.
